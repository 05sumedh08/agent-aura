## 🎬 VIDEO SCRIPT (3 Minutes)

### SECTION 1: PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:00-0:30)

**Visual:** Dark background with white text + statistics overlay

**Narration:**
> "Every year, millions of students fall behind academically—and by the time schools notice, it's often too late. **42% of students who fall behind never catch up.** **30% of at-risk students drop out** without early intervention. Schools spend **$15 billion annually** on interventions that often don't work.
>
> Why? Because schools face three critical challenges:
> 1. **Detection Lag** - They can't identify at-risk students in real-time
> 2. **Communication Delays** - Parents learn about problems too late  
> 3. **No Outcome Measurement** - No data on whether interventions actually work
>
> We need intelligent systems that can detect, notify, and measure—**in real-time.**"

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Animated statistics appearing on screen
- Icons for each challenge
- Problem → Solution transition graphic

### SECTION 2: WHY AGENTS? (0:30-1:00)

**Visual:** Architecture diagram animation

**Narration:**
> "This is where AI agents become transformative. Unlike simple automation, agents can **Think, Act, and Observe**—making them uniquely suited to solve this problem.
>
> Agent Aura is a **multi-agent system** powered by Google Gemini, featuring:
> - An **Orchestrator Agent** that coordinates everything
> - A **Data Collection Agent** that retrieves student profiles
> - A **Risk Analysis Agent** that calculates risk scores and generates notifications
> - An **Intervention Planning Agent** that creates personalized strategies
> - An **Outcome Prediction Agent** that forecasts success rates
>
> Five specialized agents, **eight intelligent tools**, working together to transform student data into life-changing interventions."

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Multi-agent architecture diagram
- Think-Act-Observe cycle animation
- Tool ecosystem visualization

---

### SECTION 3: ARCHITECTURE (1:00-1:45)

**Visual:** System architecture with data flow

**Narration:**
> "Here's how it works. The **Orchestrator Agent** receives a request to analyze a student. It delegates to specialized sub-agents:
>
> First, the **Data Collection Agent** retrieves the student's complete profile—GPA, attendance, performance metrics.
>
> Next, the **Risk Analysis Agent** calculates a risk score, identifies contributing factors, and **automatically generates an email notification** to parents and teachers—all in under one second.
>
> Then, the **Intervention Planning Agent** creates a personalized 6-week intervention plan with specific actions, resources, and timelines.
>
> Finally, the **Outcome Prediction Agent** forecasts the intervention's success rate with 85% confidence and tracks progress over time.
>
> Every step is visible in our **Glass Box UI**—you see exactly what the agent is thinking, what actions it's taking, and what it observes."

**Key Stats Overlay:**
```
⚡ <1 second per student analysis
📧 <1 second email generation
🎯 85% prediction confidence
📈 42-51% average improvement
```

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Animated workflow diagram
- Glass Box trajectory example
- Tool execution visualization
- Performance metrics
